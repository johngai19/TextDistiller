# üçû TextDistiller: Effortless Document Summarization

**TextDistiller** is an advanced, AI-driven tool designed to summarize books chapter by chapter or as a whole, providing concise yet comprehensive overviews. With TextDistiller, you can quickly grasp the core ideas and key takeaways from any book, saving time while maintaining comprehension.

## Key Features

- **Chapter-wise Summarization**: TextDistiller offers detailed summaries for each chapter, allowing you to focus on specific sections of interest.
- **Entire Book Synopsis**: For books without chapter divisions, TextDistiller condenses the entire text into a coherent summary.
- **Powered by NLP**: Utilizing state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, TextDistiller effectively captures and summarizes the most pertinent content.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: TextDistiller features a clean and intuitive interface, making the summarization process accessible and straightforward for all users.

## How TextDistiller Works

TextDistiller leverages the `T5-small` pretrained model from HuggingFace Transformers to generate accurate and readable summaries. The process includes:

1. **Chunking**: The book is divided into chunks, either by chapter or as a single unit.
2. **Tokenization**: These chunks are tokenized using the `T5Tokenizer` for compatibility with the `T5` model.
3. **Summary Generation**: The tokenized text is processed by the `T5ForConditionalGeneration` model to generate summary token IDs.
4. **Decoding**: The summary token IDs are decoded into human-readable text using the `T5Tokenizer`'s `decode()` function.
